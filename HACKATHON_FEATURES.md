## üîß Setup Instructions

### 1. Email Notifications (Optional but Recommended)

To enable email notifications:

**Option A: Using EmailJS (Free & Easy)**
1. Sign up at https://www.emailjs.com/
2. Create an email service (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
3. Create two email templates:
   - **Proposal Template**: For when movies are proposed
   - **Response Template**: For when members respond
4. Add to your `.env`:
```env
REACT_APP_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
REACT_APP_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_service_id
REACT_APP_EMAILJS_PROPOSAL_TEMPLATE=proposal_template_id
REACT_APP_EMAILJS_RESPONSE_TEMPLATE=response_template_id
```
5. Install EmailJS:
```bash
npm install @emailjs/browser
```

**Option B: No Email Setup**
- The app works without email setup
- Notifications will be logged to console (demo mode)
- All other features work perfectly

### 2. Firebase Firestore Setup

Your Firebase project should already have Firestore enabled. The app will automatically create these collections:

- **`userHistory`**: Stores user viewing history
  - Document ID: User UID
  - Fields: interactions (array), userId, email, timestamps

- **`groups`**: Stores movie groups
  - Document ID: Auto-generated
  - Fields: name, createdBy, members, invitedEmails, timestamps

- **`movieProposals`**: Stores movie proposals to groups
  - Document ID: Auto-generated
  - Fields: movieId, groupId, proposedBy, responses, yesCount, noCount, status
