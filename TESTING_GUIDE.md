console.log('User:', auth.currentUser);

// Test 2: Check if EmailJS is configured
console.log('EmailJS Service ID:', process.env.REACT_APP_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID);
console.log('EmailJS Template ID:', process.env.REACT_APP_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID);

// Test 3: Check if Firebase is connected
console.log('Firebase connected:', db !== undefined);
```
